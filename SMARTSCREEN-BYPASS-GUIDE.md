## ?? **WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN?**

SmartScreen uses **reputation-based security**:

- ? **New apps** = Low reputation = Warning shown
- ? **Popular apps** = High reputation = No warning

Once enough users install DJ Booking System, the warning will disappear automatically.

## ??? **HOW TO PERMANENTLY FIX THIS**

**For Developers:**

We're working on obtaining a **Code Signing Certificate** to eliminate this warning for all users.

**Cost:** ~$200-400/year  
**Benefit:** No more SmartScreen warnings
