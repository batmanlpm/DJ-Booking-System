=== COMPREHENSIVE FIX SUMMARY ===

COMPLETED AUTOMATICALLY:
✓ Cleaned 0 temporary build files
✓ Removed #pragma warning suppressions from AdminBookingManagementWindow.xaml.cs
✓ Fixed OrderBy to use DayOfWeek/WeekNumber/TimeSlot
✓ Commented out BookingDate assignments
✓ Removed CS0618 from project NoWarn list
✓ Fixed null safety in MainWindow.xaml.cs

REQUIRES MANUAL ATTENTION:

1. AdminBookingManagementWindow.xaml.cs (Lines 172-178)
   OLD: var conflict = _allBookings.FirstOrDefault(b => b.VenueName == selectedVenue.Name && b.BookingDate == bookingDateTime);
   FIX: Replace with proper day/week/time comparison using new properties

2. Booking.cs - Remove BookingDate property entirely
   - Property is marked obsolete but still exists
   - Remove lines ~37-38

3. App.xaml.cs - Async error handling (Lines 67-85)
   - Change underscore discard (_  = Task.Run) to proper await
   - Add .ConfigureAwait(false) to all async calls

4. Search all *.cs files for remaining "BookingDate" usage:
   - Replace with GetNextOccurrence() or OccursOn() methods
   - Use DayOfWeek, WeekNumber, TimeSlot properties

FILES STILL USING BookingDate:
  - AdminBookingManagementWindow.xaml.cs
  - BookingDetailWindow.xaml.cs
  - EditBookingWindow.xaml.cs
  - VenueDailyScheduleWindow.xaml.cs
  - Booking.cs
  - BookingViewModel.cs
  - BookingsView.xaml.cs
  - CreateBookingWindow.xaml.cs
  - BookingsView.xaml.cs

NEXT STEPS:
1. Review changes
2. Fix manual items above
3. Run: dotnet build
4. Test thoroughly
