## ?? IF YOU WANT TO EXTRACT LATER

If you change your mind and want to extract Candy-Bot in the future:

### Option 1: Create New Extraction Scripts
The process would be:
1. Create new extraction script
2. Copy files to separate project
3. Update namespaces
4. Create project files
5. Build and test

### Option 2: Keep Integrated (Current)
Benefits of keeping integrated:
- ? Easier maintenance
- ? Shared resources
- ? Single build process
- ? No duplication
- ? Simpler deployment

---

## ?? RECOMMENDATION

**Keep Candy-Bot integrated** unless you specifically need:
- Independent deployment
- Separate versioning
- Different release cycles
- Modular architecture

For most use cases, the integrated approach is simpler and more efficient.
