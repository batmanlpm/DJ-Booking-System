# Venue Tiles Interface - Complete Redesign

## Overview
Completely redesigned the Venues/Bookings interface to use interactive venue tiles instead of dropdown selection, with all button icons removed as requested.

## Key Changes

### 1. **Removed All Icons from Buttons**

**Before:**
```
+ New Booking
? Edit Booking  
?? Delete Booking
```

**After:**
```
New Booking
Edit Booking
Delete Booking
```

All buttons now display text only, no special characters or icons.

### 2. **Replaced Dropdown with Venue Tiles**

**Old Interface:**
- Dropdown selector: "-- Select Venue --"
- Required user to know venue name
- No preview of availability

**New Interface:**
- Visual tile grid showing all venues
- Each tile displays:
  - **Venue Name** (large, bold)
  - **Description** (truncated preview)
  - **Next Opening Time** (Today/Tomorrow/Date)
  - **Available Slots** (count for next 7 days)
  - "Click to view calendar" instruction

### 3. **Interactive Tiles**

**Tile Features:**
- Hover effect: Green glow and background highlight
- Click to view: Opens full calendar for that venue
- Auto-calculates next opening time
- Real-time available slot counting

### 4. **Smart Navigation**

**Flow:**
```
Venue Tiles View ? Click Tile ? Calendar View ? Back Button ? Venue Tiles View
```

Users can easily browse all venues and jump into specific schedules.

## Example Tile Display:
```
??????????????????????????????????????
? Candy Land - OPEN DECKS           ?
? Come For The Music & Stay For...  ?
?                                    ?
? Next Open: Today 18:00            ?
? Available Slots: 42               ?
?                                    ?
?     Click to view calendar         ?
