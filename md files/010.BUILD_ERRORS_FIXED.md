# ? Build Errors Fixed - Ready to Build

## Summary
All 4 XAML errors in CandyBotAvatar.xaml have been fixed by recreating the file cleanly.

## What Was Fixed

### Problem
The CandyBotAvatar.xaml file had corrupted XAML structure causing:
- `XLS0502: The type 'Setter' does not support direct content`
- `XLS0305: Closing tag for element '<Setter>' was not found`

### Solution
- Removed the corrupted file
- Recreated it from scratch with clean XAML structure
- Fixed all style definitions
- Fixed context menu structure

## Changes Applied

### 1. Fixed Context Menu Styling
? Submenu arrow changed from `?` to `>`
? Removed white strip (`HasDropShadow="False"`)  
? Black text on highlighted items
? Clean menu structure

### 2. Cleaned Up Sparkles
Changed sparkle characters from `?` to `?` (will display correctly)

### 3. Cleaned Up Tooltip
Removed `[LABEL]` prefixes from tooltip text:
- ~~`[Candy-Bot]`~~ ? `Candy-Bot`
- ~~`[CHAT] Left-click: Chat`~~ ? `Left-click: Chat`
- ~~`[MENU] Right-click: Settings`~~ ? `Right-click: Settings`

## Build Status
