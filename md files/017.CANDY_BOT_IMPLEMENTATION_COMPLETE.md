```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Voice not working"
**Solution:**
- Check Windows Speech is installed
- Go to: Settings > Time & Language > Speech
- Install a voice if none available

### "Can't find MultiDriveSearchWindow"
**Solution:**
- Make sure all files are in project
- Right-click project > Add > Existing Item
- Add the .xaml and .xaml.cs files

### "Search is slow"
**Solution:**
- Don't search all drives at once (select specific ones)
- Use `includeSubfolders: false` for faster results
- Add more excluded folders

---

## 💡 For GitHub Copilot Users

### Tell Copilot:
```
"Add voice feedback using CandyBotTextToSpeech when this action completes"
"Search for all MP3 files using MultiDriveFileSearcher"
"Make Candy speak this message"
```

### Example Prompt:
```
// Copilot: Add code to search all drives for .jpg files and have Candy 
// announce how many were found with voice feedback
```

Copilot will write:
```csharp
var searcher = new MultiDriveFileSearcher();
searcher.ApproveAllDrives();
var results = await searcher.SearchAllDrivesAsync(new List<string> { ".jpg" });
await _tts.SpeakAsync($"Found {results.Count} image files!");
```
