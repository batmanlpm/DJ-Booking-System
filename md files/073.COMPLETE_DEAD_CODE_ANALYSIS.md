## ?? OTHER FILES TO CHECK

I've created the framework for the new architecture, but haven't fully scanned these yet:

### Files to Review for Dead Code:
1. ? **MainWindow.xaml** - CLEAN (recently redesigned)
2. ? **VenueRegistrationWindow.xaml.cs** - Check for unused code
3. ? **CandyBotWindow.xaml.cs** - Check for old AI logic
4. ? **LoginWindow.xaml.cs** - Check for unused features
5. ? **AdminBookingManagementWindow.xaml.cs** - Verify all code used
6. ? **AdminVenueManagementWindow.xaml.cs** - Verify all code used

Would you like me to scan these files too?
