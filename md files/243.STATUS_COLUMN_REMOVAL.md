# Status Column Removal - UsersView

## Issue
The "Status" column was still showing in the UsersView DataGrid displaying "? Offline" for users.

## Fix Applied
Removed the Status column from `Views/UsersView.xaml`:

```xml
<!-- REMOVED -->
<DataGridTextColumn Header="Status" 
                   Binding="{Binding OnlineStatus}" 
                   Width="80"
                   IsReadOnly="True"/>
```

## Current Columns in UsersView
1. Username
2. Full Name
3. Role
4. IP Address
5. Active (checkbox)
6. Banned (checkbox)
7. DJ (checkbox - editable)
8. Venue Owner (checkbox - editable)
9. Last Login

## Note
- The `User.IsOnline` and `User.OnlineStatus` properties are kept in the model
- These are still used internally for tracking online/offline state
- They're just not displayed in the main UsersView grid
- Admins can still see online status in the dedicated "Online Users" window (Users ? ?? Online Users)

## Status
? Fixed - Status column removed from UsersView
? Compiled successfully
? Online/offline tracking still works internally
? Dedicated Online Users window still functional
