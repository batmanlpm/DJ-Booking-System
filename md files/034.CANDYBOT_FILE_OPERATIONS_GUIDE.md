### 3. **File Operations**
Three powerful operations are now available:

#### 📁 **COPY FILES**

- **Keeps original files** in their location
- Auto-renames duplicates (adds numbers like "file (1).txt")
- Files remain in the search results after copying

- **Removes files** from original location
- Auto-renames duplicates
- Files are **removed from search results** after moving

### 4. **Destination Path Controls**
