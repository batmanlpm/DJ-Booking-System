# 🍬 Candy-Bot Voice & Multi-Drive Search - Integration Guide

## ✅ What We Created

### 1. **Candy-Bot with Voice** (`CandyBotWindow_WithVoice.xaml.cs`)
- 🎤 Candy speaks EVERYTHING she types
- Not limited to pre-recorded scripts
- Uses Windows Speech Synthesis
- Toggle voice on/off with button

### 2. **Multi-Drive File Searcher** (`Services/MultiDriveFileSearcher.cs`)
- 🔍 Searches ALL accessible drives (C:, D:, K:, etc.)
- Filter by file extensions (.txt, .mp3, .docx, etc.)
- Real-time progress updates
- Safe with exclusion folders (skips Windows, System32, etc.)

### 3. **Multi-Drive Search Window** (`MultiDriveSearchWindow.xaml`)
- 🖥️ User-friendly UI
- Select which drives to search
- Quick category buttons (Documents, Music, Images, Videos, Code)
- Export results to CSV
- Open files/folders directly from results

## 🚀 How to Integrate with Visual Studio 2022

### Step 1: Replace Candy-Bot Window (For Voice)

**Option A: Replace existing file**
```bash
# Backup current file
copy CandyBotWindow.xaml.cs CandyBotWindow.xaml.cs.backup

# Replace with voice-enabled version
copy CandyBotWindow_WithVoice.xaml.cs CandyBotWindow.xaml.cs
```

**Option B: Use as new window**
- Keep both files
- Rename `CandyBotWindow_WithVoice.xaml.cs` to `CandyBotVoiceWindow.xaml.cs`
- Update class name inside file
- Create matching XAML file

### Step 2: Add Multi-Drive Search to Your Menu

In `MainWindow.xaml.cs`, add this method:

```csharp
private void OpenMultiDriveSearch_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    var searchWindow = new MultiDriveSearchWindow();
    searchWindow.Show();
}
```

In `MainWindow.xaml`, add menu item:

```xml
<MenuItem Header="🔍 Multi-Drive File Search" Click="OpenMultiDriveSearch_Click"/>
```

### Step 3: Build and Test

1. Open solution in Visual Studio 2022
2. Build Solution (Ctrl+Shift+B)
3. Fix any namespace issues if they arise
4. Run the application (F5)

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Adjust Candy's Voice

In `CandyBotWindow.xaml.cs` constructor, modify:

```csharp
_tts.SetSpeechRate(1);  // -10 to 10 (0 = normal, higher = faster)
_tts.SetVolume(80);     // 0 to 100
```

### Change Available Voices

```csharp
// Get all available voices
var voices = _tts.GetAvailableVoices();

// Select a specific voice
_tts.SelectVoice("Microsoft Zira Desktop");  // or any installed voice
```

### Customize Search Exclusions

In `MultiDriveFileSearcher.cs`, modify the default excluded folders:

```csharp
excludeFolders = new List<string>
{
    "Windows", "System32", "$Recycle.Bin",
    "ProgramData", "Program Files", "Program Files (x86)",
    "AppData", "node_modules", ".git"  // Add your own
};
```

## 🎨 For Copilot Integration

When using GitHub Copilot in VS2022:

### Prompt Examples:

**For Voice Features:**
```
// Add voice feedback when file is saved
await _tts.SpeakAsync("File saved successfully!");
```

**For File Search:**
```
// Search for all images in approved drives
var images = await _searcher.SearchAllDrivesAsync(
    new List<string> { ".jpg", ".png", ".gif" }
);
```

**Quick TTS Test:**
```csharp
// Test Candy's voice
var tts = new CandyBotTextToSpeech();
await tts.SpeakAsync("Hello! This is a test of my voice!");
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Voice not working"
- Ensure Windows Speech Synthesis is installed
- Check that `_voiceEnabled = true` in code
- Try different Windows voices in Settings > Time & Language > Speech

### "Cannot access drive X"
- Admin rights may be needed for system drives
- Some drives might be disconnected/unmapped
- Click "Refresh Drives" to reload

### "Search too slow"
- Reduce number of drives selected
- Use specific path instead of full drive
- Add more excluded folders

---

## 🎁 What's Next?

### Enhance Candy's Voice:
1. Use the 100 MP3 recordings for custom voice responses
2. Train voice cloning model (ElevenLabs, Coqui TTS)
3. Add emotion detection (happy, sad, etc.)

### Advanced File Search:
1. Save search presets
2. Schedule automated searches
3. Content-based search (search INSIDE files)
4. Duplicate file finder

## 💡 Tips for Copilot

Tell Copilot:
- "Use CandyBotTextToSpeech to add voice feedback here"
- "Search all drives for X file type using MultiDriveFileSearcher"
- "Candy should speak when this action completes"

Copilot will understand the pattern and help you implement!
