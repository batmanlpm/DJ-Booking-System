```
Documents\
  └── CandyBot-Documents\
      ├── mp3\          (all .mp3 files)
      ├── docx\         (all .docx files)
      ├── txt\          (all .txt files)
      ├── world\        (all .world files)
      └── [any-type]\   (organized by extension)
```

**Example:**
- You search for: `.mp3, .wav, .flac`

  - `Documents\CandyBot-Documents\mp3\` (350 files)

## ⚡ Performance Tips

3. **Use specific paths** if you know general location

### For Large Results:
1. **Use filters** to narrow down
2. **Export to CSV** for analysis
3. **Copy in batches** (not all at once)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No files found"
**Solutions:**
- Check drive letters are correct
- Verify file extensions are typed correctly
- Try searching without the dot (e.g., `mp3` instead of `.mp3`)
- Check if files actually exist

### "Access denied" errors
**Solutions:**
- Run program as Administrator
- Some system folders are protected
- Check file permissions

### "Search is slow"
**Solutions:**
- Select fewer drives
- Limit file types
- Exclude system folders (already automatic)

### Duplicate files when copying
**Solutions:**
