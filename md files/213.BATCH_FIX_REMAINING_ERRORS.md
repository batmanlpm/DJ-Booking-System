# BATCH FIX SCRIPT - Property Name Changes

## Files to Fix:
1. AdminBookingManagementWindow.xaml.cs
2. EditBookingWindow.xaml.cs
3. Services/FirebaseService.cs
4. ViewModels/BookingViewModel.cs

## Property Changes Needed:

### Venue Properties:
- venue.RoomName ? venue.Name
- venue.IsOpen ? venue.IsActive
- venue.DiscordWebhookUrl ? (remove, not in new model)

### Booking Properties:
- booking.Venue ? booking.VenueName
- booking.DurationHours ? (fixed 1-hour slots, remove if needed)

## Remaining Errors: 30

These are mostly property name changes in legacy admin/management windows.
Once fixed, the slot-based booking system will be fully operational!
