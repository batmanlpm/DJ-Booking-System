if (message.Contains("book") || message.Contains("slot"))
    ? Returns booking response

if (message.Contains("venue") || message.Contains("location"))
    ? Returns venue response

if (message.Contains("help") || message.Contains("how"))
    ? Returns help response

// And so on for all categories...
```

### Response Selection:
```csharp
// Multiple responses per personality
var responses = new[] 
{
    "Response 1 for this personality",
    "Response 2 for this personality",
    "Response 3 for this personality"
};

// Random selection for variety
return responses[_random.Next(responses.Length)];
```
