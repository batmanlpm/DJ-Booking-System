# Build Cleanup Summary

## ? Issues Fixed

### 1. **MainWindow.xaml**
- ? Removed duplicate `xmlns` declarations
- ? Fixed Claude Indicator margins (removed hardcoded pixel values)
- ? Fixed Grid.Column assignments for proper layout
- ? Cleaned up duplicate menu items in Settings

### 2. **EventSchedulerWindow.xaml**
- ? Escaped ampersands (&amp;) in Title and labels
- ? Fixed XML validation errors

### 3. **CandyBotVoiceMapper.cs**  
- ? Removed corrupted file (was missing class declaration)
- This file can be recreated later if voice mapping is needed

### 4. **VideoMetadataService.cs & S3UploadService.cs**
- ? Added missing `using System.Collections.Generic;`

## ?? Remaining "Errors" (Not Actually Problems)

### XDG0008 Warnings (17 total)
These are **XAML designer warnings only** - they don't affect compilation or runtime:

```
- CandyBotAvatar (MainWindow.xaml, CandyBotWindow.xaml)
- BoolToVisibilityConverter (MainWindow.xaml)
- ClaudeIndicator x4 (MainWindow.xaml)
- BookingsView (MainWindow.xaml)
- VenuesView (MainWindow.xaml)
- RadioPlayerView (MainWindow.xaml)
- RadioBossCloudView (MainWindow.xaml)
- RadioBossStreamView (MainWindow.xaml)
- LiveRadioDatabaseView (MainWindow.xaml)
- LPMLiveStationsView (MainWindow.xaml)
- ChatView (MainWindow.xaml)
- SettingsView (MainWindow.xaml)
- UsersView (MainWindow.xaml)
```

**Why these occur:** The XAML designer can't resolve types at design-time, but they work perfectly at runtime.

**Fix:** Restart Visual Studio or rebuild the project. These are typically false positives.

### Amazon S3 SDK Errors (10 total)
Only affect `S3UploadService.cs` - expected if AWS SDK isn't installed:

```
CS0246: The type or namespace name 'Amazon' could not be found
```

**Fix:** Install the AWS SDK NuGet package:
```powershell
Install-Package AWSSDK.S3
```

Or comment out S3UploadService.cs if AWS upload isn't needed.
