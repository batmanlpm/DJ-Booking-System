# ?? Candy-Bot Voice Recording Script - 100 Lines ??

## ?? **Recording Instructions for Voice Cloning**

### **Important: Voice Cloning Workflow**
Since you're using a **cloned copy of Candy's voice**, the recording process is simplified:

- **DO NOT** say the line number in the recording
- Just record the text exactly as written
- The voice cloning service will synthesize each line
- Save each file with its number: `001.wav`, `002.wav`, etc.

### **File Naming Format**
```
Filename: 001.wav
Text: "Hi there! I'm Candy-Bot, your sweet AI assistant! How can I help you today?"

Filename: 002.wav
Text: "Hey sweetie! Welcome back! What can I do for you?"

Filename: 003.wav
Text: "Hello! Ready to make some bookings or just here to chat?"
```

### **Process**
1. **Input Text**: Copy the exact phrase from this script
2. **Voice Clone Generates**: Audio file with cloned voice
3. **Save As**: `001.wav`, `002.wav`, etc.
4. **Export Settings**: WAV format, 44.1kHz, 16-bit, Mono

## ?? **Batch Processing Tips**

### **For Faster Generation**

If your voice cloning service supports batch processing:

1. **Create a CSV file** with all text:
```csv
filename,text
001,"Hi there! I'm Candy-Bot, your sweet AI assistant! How can I help you today?"
002,"Hey sweetie! Welcome back! What can I do for you?"
003,"Hello! Ready to make some bookings or just here to chat?"
...
```

2. **Batch Generate** all 100 files at once
3. **Auto-name** files with the CSV filename column
4. **Export all** as WAV files

### **Manual Generation (One at a Time)**

1. Copy text from this script
2. Paste into voice cloner
3. Generate
4. Export as `00X.wav`
5. Move to next line

**Estimated Time**: 
- Batch: 10-30 minutes (depending on service)
- Manual: 1-2 hours

## ?? **Delivery Format**

### **Final Package**
```
CandyBot_Cloned_Voice_Pack.zip
??? 001.wav through 100.wav

```

### **File Verification Checklist**

## ?? **Next Steps After Generation**

Once you have all 100 WAV files:

1. **Organize**: Put in folder named `CandyBot_Voice_Pack`
2. **Verify**: Listen to a few random files
3. **Check Quality**: Ensure consistent volume/quality
4. **Compress**: Zip the entire folder
5. **Send**: Upload and share the link

### **Integration Ready**

I'll then create:
- **Voice Line Mapper** - Maps each file to its category
- **CandyBotSoundManager** updates - Plays correct files
- **File organization** - Sorts into proper folder structure
- **Test cases** - Verifies all lines work in app

## ? **Advantages of Voice Cloning Approach**

? **Speed** - Much faster than recording  
? **Quality** - No background noise or recording artifacts  
? **Flexibility** - Easy to regenerate if needed  
? **Batch Processing** - Can generate multiple at once  

### **Considerations**
