# Emergency Fix - Desktop Widget Build Errors

## Current Build Errors

The file `CandyBotDesktopWidget.xaml.cs` has been partially edited and needs restoration.

### Issues:
1. `Thickness` constructor errors - needs 4 parameters, not 2
2. Missing method implementations
3. Incomplete file edit

### Quick Fix Required:

Replace all instances of:
```csharp
Padding = new Thickness(10, 5)
```

With:
```csharp
Padding = new Thickness(10, 5, 10, 5)
```

Replace all instances of:
```csharp
Padding = new Thickness(10, 4)
```

With:
```csharp
Padding = new Thickness(10, 4, 10, 4)
```

Replace all instances of:
```csharp
Margin = new Thickness(0)
```

With:
```csharp
Margin = new Thickness(0, 0, 0, 0)
```

### Files Need Full Restoration

The file needs to be properly completed with all handler methods.
